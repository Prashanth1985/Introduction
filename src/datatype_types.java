/*
 * Data types in Java are of different sizes and values that can be stored in a variable that is made as per convenience and circumstances to handle different scenarios or data requirements.
 * 
 * Java Data Type Categories
Primitive Data Type: These are the basic building blocks that store simple values directly in memory.
Examples of primitive data types are boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double.
Non-Primitive Data Types (Object Types): These are reference types that store memory addresses of objects.
 Examples of Non-primitive data types are String, Array, Class, Interface and Object
 
 1. Primitive Data Types:
These are the most basic data types in Java, representing fundamental values. There are eight primitive data types:
byte: Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127 (1 byte).
short: Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767 (2 bytes).
int: Stores whole numbers from approximately -2 billion to 2 billion (4 bytes). This is the most commonly used integer type.
long: Stores very large whole numbers (8 bytes).
float: Stores fractional numbers with single-precision (4 bytes). Requires an 'f' or 'F' suffix (e.g., 3.14f).
double: Stores fractional numbers with double-precision (8 bytes). This is the default for decimal numbers in Java.
boolean: Stores true or false values (1 bit).
char: Stores a single character (2 bytes), represented within single quotes (e.g., 'A').


. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types:
These data types are not predefined by Java but are created by the programmer or are built-in classes. They store references to objects in memory.
String: Used to store sequences of characters (text). Strings are immutable in Java.
Arrays: Used to store collections of elements of the same data type.
Classes: User-defined blueprints for creating objects, encapsulating data and methods.
Interfaces: Blueprints of a class, defining a contract of methods that a class must implement.
